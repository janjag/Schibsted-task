### Why prism.js

I decided to use prism.js becouse of its relativly small size (js is around 20KB with some additional plugins, css ~ 4KB) and it`s used by by large code-focused portlas like *CCS-Trics* and *Smashing Magazine*

### Next Steps

- Updating js to ES6 syntax (for simplicyty and wider browser support i used older syntax).
- Moving styles from css to scss for easier import to bigger projects and better cross-browser support.
- Adding build task that will bundle and minify css and js files.
 
### Posible improvments

- Using HTTP/2 and server push for faster loading times.
